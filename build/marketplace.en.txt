<b>Caveats</b>
<ul>
<li>It cannot be connected with the default calender app.</li>
<li>The data can (and will) contain errors and omissions. Especially the religious holidays and commemorative days are mostly catholic ones, most secular commemorative days are still missing. If you notice something I should change, just write an email to me.</li>
<li>Though translations into other languages are possible, the app currently only has German and an incomplete English translation. If you want to help me to add another translation, just write an email to me.</li>
<li>Though holidays can be shown for any country, currently there are only data for Germany (and to some degree Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Austria). If you want to use this app in another country, just write me an email.</li>
